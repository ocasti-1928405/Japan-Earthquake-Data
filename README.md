Interactive Seattle Parks & Trails Map

This is a simple, interactive web map that shows parks and trails in the Seattle area. It loads data from GeoJSON files and displays them on a full-screen Mapbox map.

The project also includes a "floating" side panel with a list of all the parks.


This map was made possible by open data from the City of Seattle.
